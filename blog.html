                        <!-- Var -->
                        <span class="font-bold underline text-xl">Var:</span>  Variables declared with var are <span class="font-bold">function scoped</span>. No matter in what block or position of the function it's declared,
                        it's <span class="font-bold">hoisted</span> to the top of the function and can be accessed from anywhere of the function.
                        
                        So, variables declared with var can be used before they are actually declared in the code. In this case the value will be
                        undefined which leads to unnecessary confusions in code. That's why let is used now instead of var to avoid code confusions and to give
                        improved scope control<br><br>
                         <!-- Let -->
                        <span class="font-bold underline text-xl">Let:</span>  Variables declared with let are <span class="font-bold">block scoped</span>. They are only accessible within the block they are declared inside a function or code
                        
                        So, variables declared with let can be used only after they are actually declared in the code, and only from inside of the block it is declared.Outside the block the let variables are not accessible, as they are <span class="font-bold">not Hoisted</span> to top like variables declared with var.<br><br>
                         <!-- Const -->
                        <span class="font-bold underline text-xl">Const:</span>  Variables declared with Const are <span class="font-bold">block scoped</span> like let variables. They are also only accessible within the block they are declared inside a function or code
                        
                        The difference of const from let is that const variables <span class="font-bold">cannot be re-assigned</span> after value is assigned once. BuT let variables gives flexibility to re-assign values as many times as wanted.

                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Runtime errors can be avoided by first determining whether a variable or property is null or undefined before using it. Few use cases of both kinds are:<br><br>

                     <span class="font-bold underline text-xl"> Use Cases of Null: </span> <br> 
                      
                      1. To indicate that a variable or property has no meaningful value that we can use later in any conditional blocks, we can set its value to null.<br><br>
                      
                      2. Any value of a variable or property may be cleared using null.<br><br>
                      
                      3. We can initialise a variable to null, and update it with the actual data once it becomes available in cases, where data retrieval or initialization is asynchronous.
                     <br><br>
                      <span class="font-bold underline text-xl"> Use Cases of Undefined: </span> <br> 
                      
                      1. Variables that are not intialized are automatically set to undefined. We can use this in conditional blocks later to find which property or variables don't have values assigned and use them accordigly<br><br>
                      
                      2. Undefined is returned when we try to access a property of an object, that does not exist. This can be used in conditional blocks to determine if a property is present in an object or not and work accordingly<br><br>
                      
                      3. When calling a function with multiple parameters, if we only want to pass values for some of them, we can set the remaining arguments as undefined. <br><br>
                      4. When trying to verify that an element exists inside an array or not, undefined will be useful here. When an element doesn't exist in an array, if we try to access it, it'll return undefined which we can use to verify that the element in not inside the array.
